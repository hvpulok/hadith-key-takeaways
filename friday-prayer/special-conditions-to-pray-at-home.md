# Special conditions to pray at home

* If it is raining and road conditions are muddy/bad, then praying at home is allowed.&#x20;

> Narrated Muhammad bin Seereen: On a rainy day Ibn `Abbas said to his Mu'adh-dhin, "After saying, 'Ash-hadu anna Muhammadan Rasulullah' (I testify that Muhammad is Allah's Messenger (ï·º)), do not say 'Haiya 'Alas-Salat' (come for the prayer) but say 'Pray in your houses'." (The man did so). But the people disliked it. Ibn` Abbas said, "It was done by one who was much better than I (i.e. the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ). <mark style="background-color:green;">No doubt, the Jumua prayer is compulsory but I dislike to put you to task by bringing you out walking in mud and slush.</mark>"
