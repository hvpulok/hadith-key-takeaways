# To raise hands to invoke pray during the Khutba



> Narrated Anas: While the Prophet (ï·º) was delivering the Khutba on a Friday, a man stood up and said, "O, Allah's Apostle! The livestock and the sheep are dying, so pray to Allah for rain." So he (the Prophet) raised both his hands and invoked Allah (for it).
