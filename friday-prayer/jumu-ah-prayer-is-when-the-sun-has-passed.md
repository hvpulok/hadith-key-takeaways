# Jumu\`ah prayer is when the sun has passed



> Jabir b. 'Abdullah reported: We used to observe (Jumu'a) prayer with the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) and then we returned and gave rest to our camels used for carrying water. Hassan \[ (one of the narrators) said: I asked Ja'far what time that was. He said.. It is the time when the sun passes the meridian.
