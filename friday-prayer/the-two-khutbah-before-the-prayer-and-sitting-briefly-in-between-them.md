# The two khutbah before the prayer, and sitting briefly in between them



> Jabir b. Samura said that the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) used to deliver the sermon while standing. He would then sit down and then stand up and address in a standing posture; and whoever informed you that he (the Holy Prophet) delivered the sermon while sitting told a lie. By Allah. I prayed with him more than two thousand times.
