# Perfume

**We can use perfume.**

> 'Abd al-Rahman son of Abd Sa'id al-Khudri reported on the authority of his father that the Messenger of Allah (ï·º) said: Bathing on Friday for every adult, using of Miswak and applying some perfume, that is available-these are essential. So far as the perfume is concerned, it may be that used by a lady.
