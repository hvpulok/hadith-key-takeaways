# Don't run if prayer started

* Don't run.
* Walk calmly.
* If missed partially complete remaining.
* If missed full prayer, perform full prayer.

> Narrated Abu Huraira: heard Allah's Messenger (ï·º)s (p.b.u.h) saying, "If the prayer is started do not run for it but just walk for it calmly and pray whatever you get, and complete whatever is missed. "
