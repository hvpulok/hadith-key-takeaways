> Narrated Ibn `Umar: One of the wives of` Umar (bin Al-Khattab) used to offer the Fajr and the `Isha' prayer in congregation in the Mosque. She was asked why she had come out for the prayer as she knew that` Umar disliked it, and he has great ghaira (self-respect). She replied, "What prevents him from stopping me from this act?" The other replied, "The statement of Allah's Messenger (ï·º): 'Do not stop Allah's women-slaves from going to Allah's Mosques' prevents him."
